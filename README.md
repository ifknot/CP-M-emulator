# CP/M emulator
This is a Windows 10 emulator for a CP/M system by Greg from his blog [www.sydneysmith.com](https://www.sydneysmith.com/wordpress/run-cpm/)

The primary goal of this repository is to coalesce the minimal setup of Greg's emulator, CP/M and tools required to run on Windows 10.

Secondarily, duplication is preservation and the work of Greg on his blog is too important to lose!
