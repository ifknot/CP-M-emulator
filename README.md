This is a Windows 10 emulator for a CP/M system by Greg from his blog [www.sydneysmith.com](https://www.sydneysmith.com/wordpress/run-cpm/)

The primary goal of this repository is to coalesce the minimal setup of Greg's emulator, CP/M and tools required to run on Windows 10.

Secondarily, duplication is preservation and the work of Greg on his blog is too important to lose!

## Installation
Installation is easy. There’s no installer to run, no DLLs to copy to places or register. Just download the ZIP, unZIP it, and double-click “run”. A CP/M computer appears right in front of you.

You can even right-click on run.bat and choose “Send to … Desktop (create shortcut)”. That way you don’t even have to find where you unZIPped it. Just double-click the desktop icon.

## Downloading
You can download a CP/M 2.2 version directly from the cpm-z80sim folder
+ `cpm-z80sim/run-cpm22.zip`     configured for 4x 8″ SSSD drives
+ `cpm-z80sim/run-cpm22G2.zip`   configured for 1x 8″ DSDD drive - use CPMFS.EXE to configure up to three more of any combination of 8″ SSSD, 5″ SSSD or 8″ DSDD.
